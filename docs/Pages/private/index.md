## About

This it the NexusMods theme for Material-MkDocs, inspired by the look of [Reloaded-II](https://reloaded-project.github.io/Reloaded-II/).

The overall wiki theme should look fairly close to the actual launcher appearance.

## Quick Setup

- **Copy the `copy-me` folder contents to your repository root** (skip `.gitignore` if you already have one)
- Add [this repository](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded.MkDocsMaterial.Themes.R2) as submodule to `docs/Reloaded`.

- Push to GitHub, this should produce a GitHub Pages site.

Your page should then be live.

!!! tip

    Refer to [Contributing](../contributing.md#website-live-preview) for instructions on how to locally edit and modify the wiki.

!!! note

    For Reloaded3 theme use `reloaded3-slate` instead of `reloaded-slate`.

!!! note

    If you run into issues deploying, make sure `Settings->Pages` has `Build and Deployment` source set as `GitHub Actions`.

## Extra
